        <h3 class="section-title">Quokka - Description</h3>
        <p>
            Aside from being happy jumping balls of fur, quokkas can also climb trees- if necessary! They can climb up to two metres high to grab leaves off trees, one of their favourite things to eat, as quokkas are herbivorous. They usually like to munch on native grasses and reach the leaves just above their head for snacks.
        </p>
        <p>
            A favourite disability assistance breed in many countries, Labradors are frequently trained to aid 
            those with blindness or autism, act as a therapy dog, or perform screening and detection work for law enforcement 
            and other official agencies.
        </p>
        <p>
            Additionally, they are prized as sporting and hunting dogs.

        <h3 id="origins" class="section-title">Quokka - Origins</h3>
        <p>
            It is the only member of the genus Setonix. Like other marsupials in the macropod family (such as kangaroos and wallabies), the quokka is herbivorous and mainly nocturnal. The quokka's range is a small area of southwestern Australia.
        </p>
        <p>
            Europeans first encountered quokkas in the 16th century, and mistakenly identified them as giant rats. Dutch explorer Willem de Vlamingh named Rottnest Island "Rattennest" (Rat's Nest) after seeing quokkas there. 
        </p>
        <p>
            Quokkas were first known to the Noongar people, the Aboriginal Australians in the southwest of Western Australia. The name "quokka" itself comes from a Noongar word, possibly "gwaga". 
        </p>
        <h3 id="Temperament" class="section-title">Quokka -Temperament</h3>
        <p>Quokkas are known for their friendly and social temperament, often referred to as "the happiest animal in the world". They are not afraid of humans, especially on Rottnest Island, where they are abundant and readily approach people. While generally docile, it's important to remember they are still wild animals and can bite, so it's best to observe them from a safe distance.Quokkas are naturally social animals and live in groups with little competition or fighting
        </p>
        <h3 id="Health" class="section-title">Quokka - Health</h3>
        <p>Quokkas are generally healthy marsupials, thriving in their natural habitats and exhibiting strong resilience. They have a long lifespan of about 10 years and are known for their social behavior and unique adaptations. However, they can be susceptible to certain health issues, especially when their environment or behavior is disrupted</p>
        <p>Quokkas are adapted to their environments and can survive in areas with limited resources, including water. They can store fat in their tails for long periods without eating and can produce concentrated urine, helping them retain moisture. </p>
        <p>Salmonellosis: Quokkas can be carriers of Salmonella, a bacteria that can cause disease in humans and other animals. Stressful events like diet changes, transportation, or drought can trigger clinical disease. 
            Bites: While quokka bites are generally harmless, they can sometimes lead to infection or complications, especially in individuals with compromised immune systems. 
            Nutritional Deficiencies: Quokkas can become malnourished if they don't have access to a balanced diet or if they are not able to forage effectively. 
            Human Interference: Providing inappropriate food or water to quokkas can lead to dependency and health problems. </p>
            <h3 id="Appearance around the world" class="section-title">Quokka - Appearance around the world</h3>
            <p>Quokkas, small marsupials native to Western Australia, are known for their charming appearance and docile nature, especially on Rottnest Island. They have a stocky build, thick fur, rounded ears, and a characteristic "smiling" face. While primarily found on Rottnest Island and Bald Island, they also inhabit parts of the mainland south of Perth. </p>
            <p>Size: Quokkas are relatively small, about the size of a domestic cat, weighing between 5.5 to 11 pounds (2.5 to 5 kg).<br>
                Fur: They have short, thick, coarse, grey-brown fur. <br>
                Face: A prominent feature is their broad, round face with small, rounded ears.<br>
                Tail: Quokkas have a short tail, mostly devoid of hair.<br>
                Claws: Their feet have claws covered in hair. <br>
                Diet: As herbivores, they primarily eat grasses, leaves, and small plants. <br>
                Behavior: Quokkas are nocturnal and spend their days resting in dense vegetation. They are known to be very approachable around humans, particularly on Rottnest Island</p>
